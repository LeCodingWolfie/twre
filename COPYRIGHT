are waived to the public domain under Creative Commons Zero (CC0) 1.0, which follows:

	Creative Commons Legal Code

	CC0 1.0 Universal

	    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
	    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
	    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
	    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
	    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
	    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
	    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
	    HEREUNDER.

	Statement of Purpose

	The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
	exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
	and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
	authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

	Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
	the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
	scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
	of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
	works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
	and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
	These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
	culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
	works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
	part through the use and efforts of others.

	For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
	expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
	associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
	is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
	elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
	terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
	Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

	1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
	protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
	Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
	limited to, the following:

	  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
	     communicate, and translate a Work;
	 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
	iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
	     likeness depicted in a Work;
	 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
	     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
	  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
	     in a Work;
	 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
	     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
	     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
	     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
	     directive); and
	vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
	     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
	     implementations thereof.

	2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
	of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
	irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
	Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
	of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
	future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
	worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
	treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
	medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
	including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
	purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
	member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
	successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
	revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
	equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
	as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

	3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
	be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
	Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
	account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
	extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
	person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
	irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
	Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
	maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
	time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
	of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
	limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
	"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
	applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
	reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
	partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
	of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
	will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
	Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
	action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
	express Statement of Purpose.

	4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

	 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
	    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
	 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
	    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
	    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
	    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
	    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
	    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
	    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
	 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
	    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
	    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
	    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
	    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
	    Work.
	 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
	    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
	    this CC0 or use of the Work.

On twre's logo:

Twitch's Glitch logo, taken from Wikimedia Commons [1] is trademarked in the US by Twitch Interactive, Inc. (registration number 5,476,086 at 22/3/2018). [2-3]

As a trademark, the logo is not protected by copyright [4]; nonetheless, the logo may not be within the scope of copyright at all 
(i.e. may not meet the threshold of originality [5], which may be substantial, at most, modest or low, and is a prerequisite to protection, 
that thus should not be of trivial authorship) [6]: p. 759-760 (cited in Feist Pub. v. Rural Tel. Serv., 499 U. S. 340) [7] 
due to the use of common geometric shapes, symbols or design of familiarity with minimal varaition in space, arrangement and linearity [8]: p. 3-5.

Compliant with Twitch's Trademark Guidelines [9], the logo refers to Twitch's platform whilist the repository is visually distinguished; 
and regardless of, trademark infringement may occur, at most, criminalized in the very limited context of counterfeiting (i.e. to traffic in with a mark,
to deceive or cause confusion, with commercial purposes; 18 U.S.C. § 2320 [10] from Pub. L. 98–473, 2178) [11], which constitutes a billion dollar industry (p. 478, 485 & 486) [12].

Furthermore, trademark infringment is established under the Lanham Act that the use is commercial, in connection with the sale or advertising of goods or services,
and without consent (15 U.S.C. § 1114, 1125 & 1127) [13], to cause confusion as to the their affiliation or origin (1-800 Contacts v. WhenU, 414 F.3d 400) [14],
whether the mark may be registered or protected by law from popularity and distinctiveness (§ 1125(c); Time v. Petersen Publishing, 173 F.3d 113) [15].

All in all, the logo, withdrawn from copyright protection, does not violate the trademark as the use is non-commercial, 
and is unable to cause confusion with Twitch's platform or any of its products, as is clear from the project's purpose, 
as is from the logo; which project is unaffiliated, in any way, with Twitch.

Therefore, twre's logo is waived to the public domain through CC0.
