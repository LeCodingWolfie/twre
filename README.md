Code is under the GPL 3.0, whereas the documentation and the rest (e.g. text such as the README and `resources/`, with exceptions, e.g. badges' vector files) in CC BY-SA 4.0; nevertheless, there are several exceptions: the logo is waived to the public domain as is Twitch's, as well as the AI banner under CC0. <sup>[a](LICENSE)</sup> <sup>[b](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)</sup> <sup>[c](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)</sup> [^1] [^2]

[^1]: As a trademark, the logo is not protected by copyright;
    <sup>[a](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/trademark-patent-copyright)</sup>
    nonetheless, the logo may not be within the scope of copyright at all (i.e. may not meet the threshold of originality,
    <sup>[b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality#United_States)</sup>
    which may be substantial, at most, modest or low, and is a prerequisite to protection, that thus should not be of trivial authorship)

    <sup>[d](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/)</sup>
    due to the use of common geometric shapes, symbols or design of familiarity with minimal varaition in space, arrangement and linearity, that do not illustrate enough creativity (p. 3-5).

    Compliant with Twitch's Trademark Guidelines,
    <sup><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/trademark/">a</a></sup>
    the logo refers to Twitch's platform whilist the repository is visually distinguished; and regardless of, trademark infringement may occur, at most, criminalized in the *very limited context of counterfeiting* (i.e. to traffic in with a *mark*, to deceive or cause confusion, with commercial purposes; 18 U.S.C. § 2320
    <sup>[b](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2320)</sup>
    from Pub. L. 98–473, 2178),
    <sup>[c](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/STATUTE-98/STATUTE-98-Pg1837/summary)</sup>
    which constitutes a billion dollar industry (p. 478, 485 & 486).
    <sup>[d](https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v24/24HarvJLTech469.pdf)</sup>

    Furthermore, trademark infringment is established under the Lanham Act that the use is commercial, in connection with the sale or advertising of goods or services, and without consent (15 U.S.C. § 1114, 1125 & 1127),
    <sup>[a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125)</sup>
    to cause confusion as to the their affiliation or origin (*1-800 Contacts v. WhenU*, 414 F.3d 400),
    <sup>[b](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/414/400/622195/)</sup>
    whether the mark may be registered or protected by law from popularity and distinctiveness (§ 1125(c); *Time v. Petersen Publishing*, 173 F.3d 113).
    <sup>[c](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/173/113/548079/)</sup>

    All in all, the logo, withdrawn from copyright protection, does not violate the trademark as the use is non-commercial, and is unable to cause confusion with Twitch's platform or any of its products, as is clear from the project's purpose, which is unaffiliated, in any way, with Twitch.


[^2]: AI art is not of human authorship, and therefore is not copyright protected: *Copyright law only protects intellectual labor, founded in the creativity of the human mind*, and is thus limited to *human creations*. <sup>[a](https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/a-recent-entrance-to-paradise.pdf)</sup> (nevertheless, the AI copyright issue is widely debated among many fields). <sup>[b](https://copyright.gov/ai/ai_policy_guidance.pdf)</sup>
